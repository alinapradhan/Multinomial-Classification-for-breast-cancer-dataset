# Multinomial-Classification-for-breast-cancer-dataset

This project applies a Decision Tree Classifier to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The dataset, provided by `sklearn.datasets`, contains 30 features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. The model uses these features to learn decision rules that effectively classify tumor types, offering both high accuracy and interpretability.

The pipeline includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics, and visualization of the confusion matrix. Decision Trees are particularly useful here due to their transparency â€” they reveal how different features influence the classification decision. This makes them valuable in medical applications, where understanding the rationale behind predictions is critical.
